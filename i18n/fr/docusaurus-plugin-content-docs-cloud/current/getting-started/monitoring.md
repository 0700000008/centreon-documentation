title: How do I monitor a resource?
---

To monitor a resource in Centreon Cloud:

1. Create the resource (see creating a host, creating a service, a metaservice)
2. Link the resource to the poller you want it monitored by.
3. Link the resource to the correct template provided by a <!--[Plugin Pack]().-->
4. The resource appears in the [Resources status](../alerts-notifications/resources-status.md) page, where you can track any changes in status.
