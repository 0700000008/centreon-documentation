## Monitoring a resource

To monitor a resource in Centreon Cloud:

1. Create the resource.
2. Link the resource to the poller you want it to be monitored by.
3. Link the resource to the correct template provided by a [Plugin Pack](../monitoring/pluginpacks.md).
4. [Export the configuration](../monitoring/monitoring-servers/deploying-a-configuration.md). The resource appears in the **Monitoring > Resources status** page, where you can track any changes in status.
