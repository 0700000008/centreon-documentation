Release date: `October 27, 2023`

  <summary>New features</summary>

**Resources Status**:
- In addition to the current view (**All** view), we have added 2 new views allowing to visualize only the services
  (**By Services** view), as well as a view to visualize the hosts and all their attached services (**By Hosts** view).
  Those two new views have been redesigned based on those coming from deprecated pages.
- We have also completely redesigned filters management, making it easier to select resources.

Deprecated pages will be removed in the next major version.
